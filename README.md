Hey lovely person reading this, 
the files in this project are related to a project outside course scope at The University of Copenhagen.
The project was made by me, Amanda Linea JÃ¸rgensen, in the 5'th semester of my Bachelors degree in Molecular Biomedicine at The University of Copenhagen. 
My main counselor has been Professor Kresten Lindorf-Larsen, and my day to day counselor has been Lasse M. Blaabjerg.
